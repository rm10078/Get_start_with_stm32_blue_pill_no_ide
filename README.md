# Get start with stm32

Follow all command step to step



## Deployment

#### Step:-1
install st-link and compiler for stm32

```bash
  sudo apt install stlink-tools gcc-arm-none-eabi
```

#### Step:-2
Clone the libopencm3 all library are inside this repo

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3-template
```
```bash
  cd libopencm3-template
```
```bash
  git submodule init
```
```bash
  git submodule update
```
```bash
  make
```
#### Step:-3
Make a folder for your project.  <br> inside the folder make two file one is Makefile and other is main.c file.
</br> project link:- https://github.com/rm10078/Get_start_with_stm32_blue_pill_no_ide/tree/main/stm_blink_first

#### Step:-4
After typeing code run make command on your project dir location

```bash
  make
```

#### Step:-5
Check your st-link v2 programmer detected or not
ST-LINK v2
![App Screenshot](https://github.com/rm10078/Get_start_with_stm32_blue_pill_no_ide/blob/main/img/st-link.jpg?raw=true)
